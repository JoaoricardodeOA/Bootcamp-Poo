# Bootcamp-Poo
 I created an application in portuguese to simulate a Bootcamp, at the src i created an interface to make this application more complete, there is an abstract method called "conte√∫do" to call two other classes, 'mentoria" and "cursos', there are two other classes: bootcamp and devs, they will be used at the main to make lists of previous classes, and make the application works.
